 /*

 1- A Java string is a sequence of characters that exist as an object of the class java. lang.
        Java strings are created and manipulated through the string class.
        Once created, a string is immutable -- its value cannot be changed.
 2- There are two ways to create a String object:
        By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes.
        By new keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.
 3- It is immutable because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.
 4- String pool is a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores.
